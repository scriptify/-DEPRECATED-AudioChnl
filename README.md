# AudioChnl
### One Audio object, multiple effects. Easy.

## What is an AudioChnl?
It's an extension of the [Chnl](https://github.com/scriptify/Chnl) module: This module is made for playing, pausing, stopping and manipulating Audio-objects.

If you are not familiar with the [Chnl](https://github.com/scriptify/Chnl) module, [Just have a look at it](https://github.com/scriptify/Chnl).

__Attention__: Since the [webaudio-effect-unit](https://github.com/scriptify/webaudio-effect-unit) has reached v.1.1.0, the way how the effects work has changed. Have a look at it's repository for more details. Make sure to do this BEFORE you update. If you have difficulties or questions, just open an issue! I am always glad if I can help. :smile:
